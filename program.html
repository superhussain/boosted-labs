      <h2>Pre-Accelerator Prep Program</h2>
      <p>Our signature Pre-Accelerator Prep Program (PAPP) takes founders through a journey to accelerate their business and build connections for up to a year. The program consists of individuals with business ideas applying to get access to all the resources they need to prepare for their next step into a top-accelerator company. An all inclusive platform, PAPP, will make the new founders a part of our community of mentors, investors and corporate partners.</p>

      <h2>How to Apply</h2>
      <p>Boosted Labs is accepting applications for the 2017 - 2018 accelerator cycle. It will take place in Toronto, ON from May 2017 to April 2018. If you want to apply, please submit your application online by 11:59 pm ET by March 31, 2017. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the deadline.</p>
      <p>On April 20 and 21, the applicants who are selected to proceed to the second round will be invited we’ll invite the groups that seem most promising to meet us in Toronto.</p>
      <p>We decide who to accept into our program after each day of interviews. Decisions will include the amount we’ll invest and the percent of the company we’d want for it.</p>
      <p>If we invest in you, your group is expected to move to the Toronto area for the 12 month cycle beginning May 2017. Of course you are permitted to leave anytime you feel like your idea is ready for the next step, to head over to an acceleration.</p>
      <p>After you’re accepted, we’ll immediately get to work helping you set up your business, if it isn’t already. As soon as your company exists, we’ll write a cheque to it for the investment and provide you with the tools necessary to spend that money wisely.</p>
      <p>Boosted Labs will also provide you with office space! We offer a variety of facilities to cater you in the best Canadian way possible. It is no coincidence that so many successful startups have been boosted by us.</p>
      <p>During the 12 month cycle we’ll have dinners every other Tuesday for all our Boostees. At each dinner we’ll invite an expert in some aspect of startups to speak.</p>
      <p>We have regular office hours year round for startups who want to talk about what they’re building, or get advice on dealing with investors. We will  also have occasional events at Boosted Labs.</p>
      <p>During the 12 months we introduce startups individually to people who provide specialized mentoring in addition to the founders of other startups who tend to be especially helpful. As the cycle nears to an end we also focus on preparing the companies to be able to successfully pitch their startups to meet the rigorous standards of the top accelerators around the world.</p>
      <p>Near the end of the 12 months, we organize an event called Demo Day at which the startups present their business plans to a carefully selected, invite-only audience.</p>
      <p>Boosted Labs doesn’t really end after 12 months; only the dinners do. We continue to give advice and make introductions as long as our Boostees need—and so does the informal network of Boosted Lab-funded companies.</p>

      <h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
      <p>As of now we specifically focus on Muslims across Ontario with great ideas and an entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
      <p>How do we choose who to fund? The people in your group are what matter most to us. We look for brains, motivation, and a sense of design. Experience is helpful but not critical.</p>
      <p>Your idea is important too, but mainly as evidence that you can have good ideas. Most successful startups change their idea substantially.</p>
      <p>The ideal company would have two or three founders. We’ll consider those with four or five. We’re reluctant to accept one-person companies, though, for now at least.</p>
      <p>International founders, please note: we are not accepting international applicants at this time but keep checking back because we will be in the future.</p>
